# databind
Test project with GWT databinding based on Errai and js proxies over native java classes.
The main goal was performance and resulting js bundle size optimization, which is significantly better than "pure" Errai implementation.

Errai databinding documentation is PARTIALLY applicable to this project: http://erraiframework.org/getting-started/index.html#ErraiDataBindingPage
